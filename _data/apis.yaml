  description: |-
    AWS CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
    You can use AWS CloudFormations?sample templates?or create your own templates to describe the AWS resources, and any associated dependencies or runtime parameters, required to run your application. You do not need to figure out the order for provisioning AWS services or the subtleties of making those dependencies work. CloudFormation takes care of this for you. After the AWS resources are deployed, you can modify and update them in a controlled and predictable way, in effect applying version control to your AWS infrastructure the same way you do with your software. You can also visualize your templates as diagrams and edit them using a drag-and-drop interface with the?AWS CloudFormation Designer.
    You can deploy and update a template and its associated collection of resources (called a stack) by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, or APIs. CloudFormation is available at no additional charge, and you pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.

- name: AWS CloudHSM
  description: |-
    The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.
    AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure key management. You can securely generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management requirements without sacrificing application performance.
    The AWS CloudHSM service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network latency, which can improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add secure and durable key storage to your applications.

- name: AWS ElastiCache
  description: Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate,
    and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. The service improves
    the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from
    fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based
    databases. Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes,
    reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides
    a resilient system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow
    website and application load times. Through integration with Amazon CloudWatch,
    Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key performance metrics associated
    with your Redis or Memcached nodes.

- name: AWS Snowball
  description: |-
    Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet.
    With Snowball, you don’t need to write any code or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and you can track the job status via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console.
    Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

    including domain validation, end-to-end encryption, and the chains of trust set
    up by certificate authorities. If left unchecked, these flaws can facilitate a

    Google supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios such as those for web server, installed,

    the Google API Console. Then your client application requests an access token
    from the Google Authorization Server, extracts a token from the response, and
    sends the token to the Google API that you want to access. For an interactive
    demonstration of using OAuth 2.0 with Google (including the option to use your
    own client credentials), experiment with the OAuth 2.0 Playground.

  description: 'A new reality is emerging as we adjust to the world where sensors
    on everything — from phones to cars to medical devices — track every movement,
    every blink of the eye, every heartbeat and location. Troves of data are being
    collected, governed, and analyzed in quantities hitherto unfathomable. These data
    can help us live longer and be better informed about our interests and dislikes.
    They can also keep us better connected and more entertained. Yet, significant
    technological and social issues exist around how these data should be properly
    handled. An outmoded regulatory environment and an increasingly lucrative market
    for digital profiles have formed a potent cocktail, rendering our information
    increasingly vulnerable to those who wish to exploit it.  A boundless world awaits,
    but specific safeguards must be taken to protect personal and societal interests.  With
    its years of research and development in trusted distributed computing, networked
    security, and social computing, Intertrust is up to this evermore important challenge:
    To build trust in a connected world.'

    sample code in several different programming languages and frameworks. This increases
    API adoption, expands usage among existing users, and alleviates the burden of
    customer support.

  description: Mockaroo lets you generate up to 1,000 rows of realistic test data

    want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate a production
    environment. In production, you'll have an army of users banging away at your
    app and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code. If you're
    hand-entering data into a test environment one record at a time using the UI,
    you're never going to build up the volume and variety of data that your app will
    accumulate in a few days in production. Worse, the data you enter will be biased
    towards your own usage patterns and won't match real-world usage, leaving important
    bugs undiscovered.

    Applications running on serverless architectures scale up and down on demand with
    high availability. There is no need to provision or manage servers. Your code
    runs only when it's needed, and you only pay for the compute time you use. Stackery
    provides operational tools for developers building serverless applications. Easily
    detect and surface application errors, version control your serverless infrastructure,
    and securely manage configurations and deployments. Stackery helps developers
    build production-grade serverless applications by providing an abstraction layer

  description: Testpoint.io exists to support the ausdigital.org implementer community.
    Unlike single provider RESTful services(e.g. Google or Facebook APIs), a B2B process
    like e-invoicing needs multiple providers to support the same standard interface
    and to make their services discoverable. As the detailed specifications at ausdigital.org
    describe, there are a number of moving parts. Without a suite of test services
    and test cases, there would be a major risk of incompatible implementations.
